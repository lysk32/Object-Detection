# Object Detection Project

Hello, fellow computer vision enthusiasts! üëÅÔ∏èüñ•Ô∏è

This repository contains a comprehensive tutorial on implementing an object detection project. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced developer looking to dive into object detection, this step-by-step guide will help you understand and implement a robust object detection system.

## Project Overview

This project focuses on building an object detection model using [specific framework/library, e.g., YOLO, Faster R-CNN, SSD]. We'll cover everything from data preparation to model training and evaluation.

## Features

- Data collection and annotation
- Model architecture explanation
- Training pipeline setup
- Inference and visualization
- Performance evaluation

## Getting Started

To get started with this project:

1. Clone this repository
2. Install the required dependencies (listed in the `requirements.txt` file)
3. Open the Jupyter notebook and follow along!

## Usage

The project is contained in a single Jupyter notebook, providing detailed explanations and code. To use this notebook:

1. Ensure you have Jupyter installed
2. Navigate to the project directory
3. Run `jupyter notebook` in your terminal
4. Open the `Object_Detection_Tutorial.ipynb` file
